description: 'This resource includes topics like: planning and strategery, mechanics
  and sensors, ball storage, archimedes would be proud, screw casing and gears, one-way
  bottom gate, servo-operated top gate, ir sensors, image processing, color voting,
  positions in 3-space, more math (you want to come here), driving in arcs, docking
  with field goals, kalman odometry, mapping (or lack thereof), force fields, nifty
  telemetry, robot strengths, steady-state lifting device, fast, effective image processing
  algorithm, good docking procedure, traveled in arcs, robot weaknesses and suggested
  solutions, heavy robot = slow,

  known modes of failure, we never even saw half of the field, didn?t use exploration
  round, takes balls slightly over 20 seconds to climb screws, definitely not made
  by mechanical engineers, there?s so much that could have gone wrong, results, and

  lessons learned.'
